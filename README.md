In this project, I'll demonstrate the Sliding Window approach. It's a technique
in algorithm design that I think is pretty neat.

Some time ago, I found a problem that essentially boiled down to the following
assumptions.

1) Any pair of adult rabbits gives birth to a litter of eight new rabbits (four female and four male) each month.
2) Rabbits become adult when they turn five months old.
