In this project, I'll demonstrate the Sliding Window approach. It's a technique
in algorithm design that I think is pretty neat.

Some time ago, I found a problem that essentially boiled down to the following
assumptions and questions.

1) Any pair of adult rabbits gives birth to a litter of eight new rabbits (four female and four male) each month.
2) Rabbits become adult when they turn five months old.

Starting with just one pair of adult rabbits, what's the number of
a) rabbits; and
b) adult rabbits;
after 24 months?
